# Adidas US Sales Performance Audit

**An end-to-end Business Intelligence project analyzing sales efficiency and regional growth.**

---

## Project Overview

This project simulates a real world Business Intelligence audit for Adidas US.  
I performed a deep dive into sales data to identify which regions, retailers, and sales methods drive the most profit.

The project demonstrates:
- Cleaning and analyzing raw data in SQL
- Building an interactive executive dashboard in Power BI

### The Goal
Uncover “Profit Paradoxes” - situations where high sales volume does not necessarily equal high profitability.

---

## The Approach

- Data Profiling & Cleaning (SQL)
Conducted a thorough audit to handle duplicates, validate currency logic, and ensure data consistency.

- SQL Analysis
Engineered complex queries to detect regional underperformers and calculated Month-over-Month (MoM) growth rates.

- Data Modeling
Established a Star Schema in Power BI by connecting fact tables to a central Calendar dimension for advanced time series analysis.

- DAX Engineering
Developed custom measures for Profit Margin % and Revenue Efficiency to move beyond basic aggregates.

## Key Insights

### The In Store Profit Paradox
While Online channels drive the highest total revenue (~$45M), In-store sales lead in efficiency with a significantly higher 35% Profit Margin.

### Regional Powerhouse
The West Region dominates the portfolio, contributing 30% ($36M) of total revenue, largely driven by the high performance of "West Gear."

### Seasonal Velocity
Sales analysis shows significant peaks in July and December, highlighting critical windows for inventory optimization.

## Business Recommendations

### Channel Optimization
Investigate high operating costs in the Online channel to align its margins with In store performance.

### Strategic Scaling
Use the "West Gear" partnership as a blueprint for underperforming retailers like Amazon or Walmart.

### Inventory Planning
Prioritize stock levels in early Q3 to capitalize on proven seasonal spikes.
